# Hotel Room Price Prediction Project

Understanding property prices is essential for gauging an area's development. In the hotel industry, setting reasonable prices is vital for competitiveness and profitability. Our project aimed to build a predictive model for hotel room prices using various regression methods, including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBRegressor, and MLP.

## Introduction

Our goal was to develop a robust model capable of predicting hotel room prices based on their features. Leveraging a combination of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, we sought to enhance transparency and efficiency in the real estate market. By merging advanced statistical methods with domain knowledge, we aimed to create a meaningful predictive tool for property buyers, sellers, and industry professionals.

## Project Overview

- Employed regression methods such as Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBRegressor, and MLP.
- Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for reducing data complexity.
- Focus on enhancing transparency and efficiency within the real estate market.
- Aimed to provide stakeholders with an accurate pricing tool for informed decision-making.

## Conclusion

Our analysis revealed that while traditional linear models like Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge performed moderately, ensemble methods such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBRegressor demonstrated superior performance in predicting hotel room prices. Specifically, XGBRegressor showcased the highest accuracy among the models tested. This suggests the effectiveness of ensemble methods in capturing intricate data patterns and providing more precise forecasts compared to linear models and MLP.
